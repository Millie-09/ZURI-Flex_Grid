# ZURI-Flex_Grid
This repo contains task submission from Zuri
To perform this task, I made use of Vscode,
Using HTML and CSS to recreate the template as sent for the task.
I realized that I have become exceedingly comfortable with CSS Flex, and made more use of it while manoeveuring margins, padding and borders.
CHEERS!
